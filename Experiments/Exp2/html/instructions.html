    <h2>BE PATIENT!</h2>
    <p>
      <b>The task will take a few seconds to load (around 10 MB)</b>. Unless you have a slow connection, it should take less than a minute in total.
    </p>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      The experiment consists of three different phases, as illustrated in the figure below. <br>In the identical pre and post phases, you'll judge how similar different images of trees are from each other. <br>In the main task, you'll pretend to be a gardener who has to figure out which type of trees grow best in two different gardens. <br> There will be several breaks and detailed instructions will be provided once you go into full screen and click on the "start" button. <br><br><br>

    <h2>Full-screen requirement</h2>
    <p>
      We ask you to keep the window on fullscreen mode for the whole length of the experiment. This is because it is a psychological experiment and we need you to complete the experiment without distraction or doing other things at the same time. <b>If you leave the fullscreen mode the experiment will be cancelled</b>.
    </p>
    <h2>Duration and payment</h2>
    <p>
      During this experiment, you will need to give a fixed number of responses. You'll be doing an experiment with three different phases. The total duration of the experiment is estimated to be around <b>1 hour</b>. The pre and post block of this experiment are identical and self-paced. The main experiment has a fixed duration but as we're allowing you to take breaks in between the different sub-blocks, you might need slightly more or less time in total.  <br>Thus, the duration of the whole experiment depends on how quickly you respond, but we ask you to try your best, rather than just giving quick but careless responses!<br>
      Once you finish with the task, you will receive a code that you can paste in order for us to accept your HIT.
    </p>
    <h2>Get ready!</h2>
    <p>

      When you have read this, you can move forward with the instructions. Good luck!
